#  Frequently Asked Questions

I recommend you read all of these as you will learn many interesting things. Or you can use Ctrl-F to search for a specific topic.

<!-- toc -->

### _1. Can you give me documentation/examples links?_
- Follow [this installation guide](https://telegrambots.github.io/book/#-installation) to install the latest versions of the library.
- Here is on the [main documentation website](https://telegrambots.github.io/book/).
- You can find [more bot example projects](https://github.com/TelegramBots/Telegram.Bot.Examples) here
- Search the [official API documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) and [official bots FAQ](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq).
- check tooltips in your IDE, or navigate with F12 on API methods and read/expand comments.

>If you're C# beginner, you should learn about [async programming](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/asynchronous-programming/).

### _2. My update handler fails or stops executing at some point_
You likely have an exception somewhere. You should place a `try..catch` around your whole update handler.  
Also, you should learn to <ins>use a debugger</ins> and go step-by-step through your code to understand where and why an exception is raised. See next question.

### _3. Apparently my update handler gets a_ `NullReferenceException`
Not all updates are about an incoming Message, so `update.Message` could be null. (see also `update.Type`)  
Not all messages are text messages, `message.Text` could be null (see also `message.Type`). etc...  
So please <ins>use a debugger</ins> to check the content of your variables or structure fields and make sure your code can handle all cases.

### _4. How to add buttons under a message?_
Pass an [InlineKeyboardMarkup](2/reply-markup.md#inline-keyboards) into the `replyMarkup` parameter when sending the message. You will likely need to create a `List<List<InlineKeyboardButton>>` for rows&columns  
_See also next question._

### _5. How to handle a click on such inline buttons?_
For buttons with callback data, your update handler should handle `update.CallbackQuery`.
_(Remember that not all updates are about `update.Message`. See question #3)_  

Your code should answer to the query within 10 seconds, using `AnswerCallbackQueryAsync` _(or else the button gets momentarily disabled)_

### _6. How to show a popup text to the user?_
It is only possible with inline callback button _(see above questions)_.  
Use `AnswerCallbackQueryAsync` with some text, and pass parameter `showAlert: true` to display the text as an alert box instead of a short popup.

### _7. How to fill the input textbox of the user with some text?_
There is not a simple direct method for this, but here is what you can try:
- With a [Public username link](https://core.telegram.org/api/links#public-username-links): `t.me/username?text=Hello+World`  
  _(works only if target is a user/bot and not the current chat)_
- With a [Share link](https://core.telegram.org/api/links#share-links): `tg://msg_url?url=https://example.com&text=Hello+World`  
  _(user must select a target first)_
- With a [Bot deep link](https://core.telegram.org/api/links#bot-links): `t.me/botusername?start=param`  
  _(param is limited to base64 characters, bot will receive `/start param`)_
- With a [ReplyKeyboardMarkup](2/reply-markup.md#custom-keyboards): buttons under the textbox to send pre-made texts
- With an [Inline Mode bot](3/inline.md) and `SwitchInlineQuery` inline buttons, you can make the user pre-type the name of your bot followed by some query

### _8. How to fetch previous messages?_
You can't with Bot API but it's possible with [WTelegramBot](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WTelegramBot#readme-body-tab).  
Normally, bots only get messages at the moment they are posted. You could archive them all in a database for later retrieval.

### _9. How to fetch a list of all users in chat?_
You can't with Bot API but it's possible with [WTelegramBot](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WTelegramBot#readme-body-tab).  
Normally, bots can only get the list of admins (`GetChatAdministratorsAsync`) or detail about one specific member (`GetChatMemberAsync`)  
Alternatively, you can keep track of users by observing new messages in a chat and saving user info into a database.

### _10. How to send a private message to some random user?_
You can't. Bots can only send private messages to users that have already initiated a private chat with your bot.

### _11. How to detect if a user blocked my bot?_
You would have received an `update.MyChatMember` with `NewChatMember.Status == ChatMemberStatus.Kicked`  
If you didn't record that info, you can try to `SendChatActionAsync` and see if it raises an exception.

### _12. How to set a caption to a media group (album)?_
Set the `media.Caption` (and `media.ParseMode`) on the first media

### _13. How to write a bot that make questions/answers with users?_
Either you can code a complex state machine workflow, saving where each user is currently in the discussion.  
Or you can just use [YourEasyBot](https://github.com/wiz0u/YourEasyBot) which makes sequential bots very simple to write... _(or one of the [other frameworks](https://github.com/TelegramBots/Telegram.Bot/wiki) available for Telegram.Bot)_

### _14. How to make font effects in message?_
Pass a `ParseMode.Html` _(or `ParseMode.MarkDownV2`)_ to argument `parseMode`. See [formatting options](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#formatting-options).  
⚠️ I <ins>**highly recommend**</ins> you choose HTML formatting because MarkDownV2 has A LOT of annoyingly reserved characters and you will regret it later.

### _15. Where can I host my bot online for cheap/free?_
I would recommend you make an ASP.NET webhook bot and host it on some WebApp hosting service.  
For example, [Azure WebApp Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/app-service/web) has a [F1 Free plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/) including 1 GB disk, 1 GB ram, 60 minutes of daily cumulated active CPU usage _(more than enough for most bots without heavy use)_. And publishing to Azure is very easy from VS.  
A credit-card is necessary but you shouldn't get charged if you stay within quotas.  
Other cloud providers might also offer similar services.

### _16. Is there some limitation/maximum about feature X?_
See <https://limits.tginfo.me> for a list of limitations.

### _17. How to populate the bot Menu button / commands list?_
You can either do this via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) _(static entries)_, or you can use `SetMyCommandsAsync` for more advanced settings  
⚠️ This can only be filled with bot commands, starting with a `/` and containing only latin characters `a-z_0-9`

### _18. How to receive `ChatMember` updates?_
You should specify all update types **including ChatMember** in `AllowedUpdates` array on `StartReceiving`:`ReceiverOptions` or `SetWebhookAsync`

### _19. How to get rid of past updates when I restart my bot?_
Pass true into `StartReceiving`:`ReceiverOptions`:`DropPendingUpdates` or `SetWebhookAsync`:`dropPendingUpdates`
Alternatively, you can call `await bot.DropPendingUpdatesAsync()` before polling or using [`bot.OnUpdate`](3/updates/polling.md#by-setting-botonupdate-andor-botonmessage).

### _20. Difficulties to upload & send a file/media?_
- Make sure you `await` until the end of the send method before closing the file (a "`using`" clause would close the file on leaving the current { scope }
- If you just filled a `MemoryStream`, make sure to rewind it to the beginning with `ms.Position = 0;` before sending
- If you send a media group, make sure you specify different filenames on `InputFile.FromStream`

### _21. How to fetch all medias from an album/media group ?_
Medias in a media group are received as separate consecutive messages having the same `MediaGroupId` property. You should collect them progressively as you receive those messages.  
There is no way to know how many medias are in the album, so:
- look for consecutive messages in that chat with same `MediaGroupId` and stop when it's not the same
- stop after 10 media in the group (maximum)
- use a timeout of a few seconds not receiving new messages in that chat to determine the end

### _22. How to send a custom emoji❓_
⚠️ It costs about ~$5,000 !! 😱
- First you need to buy a reserved username on [Fragment](https://fragment.com/).
- Then you need to pay an [additional upgrade fee](https://fragment.com/about#assigning-collectible-usernames-to-telegram) of 1K TON to apply that username to your bot.  
- Finally, your bot can now post custom emojis using specific [HTML](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#html-style) or [Markdown](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#markdownv2-style) syntax (or entity).

To post to a specific group, there is an alternative solution:
- Have premium members boost your group to Level 4.
- Then you can assign a custom emoji pack to your group that your members AND bots can use freely in group messages.

### _23. How to upgrade my existing code? You keep breaking compatibility!_
A new lead developer (Wizou) is now in charge of the library and commits to reduce code-breaking changes in the future.  
Version 21.x of the library have been much improved to facilitate [migration from previous versions](migrate/Version-21.x.md) of the library, and include a lot of helpers/implicit operators to simplify your code.

### _24. Can I use several apps/instance to manage my bot?_
You can call API methods (like sending messages) from several instances in parallel  
**BUT** only one instance can call method GetUpdates (or else you will receive _Telegram API Error 409: Conflict: terminated by other getUpdates request_)

### _25. How do I get the user id from a username?_

You can't with Bot API but it's possible with [WTelegramBot](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WTelegramBot#readme-body-tab).  
Alternatively, you could store in database the mapping of `UserId`<->`Username`.  
Remember that not every user has a username.

### _26. How to receive messages from channels?_

Your bot has to be added as administrator of the channel.
You will then receive the messages as `update.ChannelPost` or `update.EditedChannelPost`.

### _27. How to sent the same media multiple times_
The first time, you will send the media with a stream (upload). Next times, you will use its **FileId**:
```csharp
var sent = await bot.SendVideoAsync(chatId, stream, ....);
var fileId = sent.Video.FileId

// next times:
await bot.SendVideoAsync(chatId2, fileId, ...);
```
For photos, use `sent.Photo[^1].FileId`

### _28. Why are my updates being processed sequentially when I'm using webhooks?_
Telegram servers send updates to your webhook sequentially, one at a time. They will not send the next update until you have acknowledged the current one. To acknowledge an update, you must respond with an HTTP Status Code 200.

Telegram not pushing updates concurrently means that even if you're using webhooks with ASP.NET Core, you won't be able to leverage ASP.NET Core's built-in concurrency features.

For most use cases and lightweight bots, this sequential processing should not pose a problem. However, if your bot handles long-running processes for some or all updates, it may be beneficial to implement an internal queue using [Channels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/channels) or a queue implementation such as `Queue<T>` or `ConcurrentQueue<T>`.
