# Downloading files

First, read the [documentation on `getFile`](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getfile) method.

To download file you have to know its file identifier - `FileId`.

## Finding the file identifier

Telegram Bot API has several object types, representing file:
[`PhotoSize`], [`Animation`], [`Audio`], [`Document`], [`Video`], [`VideoNote`], [`Voice`], [`Sticker`].

The file identifier for each file type can be found in their `FileId` property (e.g. `Message.Audio.FileId`).

The exception is photos, which represented as an array of [`PhotoSize[]`][`PhotoSize`] objects.
For each photo Telegram sends you a set of [`PhotoSize`] objects - available resolutions, you can choose from.
Generally, you will want the highest quality - the last [`PhotoSize`] object in the array.
With LINQ, this boils down to `Message.Photo.Last().FileId`.

## Downloading a file

Downloading a file from Telegram is done in two steps:

1. Get file information with `getFile` method. Resulting [`File`] object contains `FilePath` from which we can download the file.
2. Downloading the file.

```C#
{{#include ../../../Examples/3/Files.cs:get-file}}
```

The URL from which you can now download the file is `https://api.telegram.org/file/bot<token>/<FilePath>`.

To download file you can use `DownloadFileAsync` function:

```C#
{{#include ../../../Examples/3/Files.cs:download-file}}
```

For your convenience the library provides you a helper function that does both - `GetInfoAndDownloadFileAsync`:

```C#
{{#include ../../../Examples/3/Files.cs:get-and-download-file}}
```
